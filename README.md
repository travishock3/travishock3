## 📜 A Poem for the Repository of Thought

> In lines of code I seek the truth,  
> Beyond the loops of age and youth.  
>  
> A silent key, a blinking light,  
> In terminal’s shade I find the night.  
>  
> With every push, a part of soul,  
> In each commit, a subtle goal.  
>  
> From branches forked, my mind does roam,  
> Yet `main` remains my constant home.  
>  
> Errors echo like thoughts unclear,  
> Yet logs and time will make them steer.  
>  
> For what is life but debugged dreams?  
> And knowledge built on silent schemes.  
>  
> So here I code, in lines austere,  
> A pilgrim through the software sphere.
